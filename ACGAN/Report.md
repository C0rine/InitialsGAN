# ACGAN results

Overview of the results for the ACGAN. The first section shows the results when trained on the full dataset, the second section when the dataset was reduced to one letter ('S' as this letter occurs most often in the dataset). 

(Shitty) explanation of the evaluation metrics:

* __SSIM__: mean from the [SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) between 100 random generated image pairs from the same class. Measure diversity within a class. SSIM between images ranges between -1 and 1, -1 being the inverse of eachother, 1 being the same image.
* __Inception Score__: measures the diversity of images across classes and 'classifiability' of generated images using a pre-trained classifier.
* __Classification Accuracy__: Use a pretrained classifier and check if images generated when conditioned on a certain feature are also actually classified as such. 
* __Nearest neighbors__: for a generated image, finds the nearest neighbor from the training dataset to make sure the GAN is not just reproducing images.

### Nearest Neighbor examples
In the image rows below, the first image is an image generated by the GAN and the consequent three images the NNs from the training set.
